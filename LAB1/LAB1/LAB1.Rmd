##Question 2 - What are the pros and cons of deleting missing data?
The pros of deleting missing data would be that you would be given a full summary of only full information. Another advantage would be that it would make your data look
cleaner.
The cons of deleting missing data is that you would be possibly skewing results. 

Most literature, suggests that there are different types of missing data. Missing at Random(MAR), Missing at complete random(MCAR) and Missing at not random(MNAR). Out of these three missing data types the two randoms (MAR) and (MCAR) are safe to ignore.
